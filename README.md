# FAQ
## How to enable the snippets on a file other than html?
<s>Add the following code to the project settings.json or global settings.json :
```
"files.associations": {
        // extension name : html
        "*.ejs": "html",
        "*.js": "html"
    }
```
the above code will allow html snippet to work on .ejs and .js files, amend to fit your needs.</s>
